File_searcher.py is a Python 3 script designed to locate and interact with files within the current directory and all its subdirectories. It provides a simple command-line interface that allows users to search for a file by name and then choose one of three actions:

Modify (m) – Append custom text to the end of the file without removing any existing content.

Copy (c) – Duplicate the file to a user-specified destination directory.

Delete (d) – Permanently remove the file from the system after a confirmation prompt.

Important Note: This tool only searches for files within the directory where the script is executed and its subdirectories. It does not scan your entire system or other unrelated directories. This is my first hacking script, and future updates will expand its capabilities.
